This application, Fractal Maze, is just a exercise when I start to learn 
opencv, and QT by the way. It includes 3 tools:
    AnalyzeMaze : Analyze fractal maze image and output to .ana(analysis result)
                  and .loc(pin location)
    FractalMaze : A QT based GUI which provided to players as a maze game.
    CrackMaze   : Solving fractal maze puzzle according to analysis result of
                  AnalyzeMaze(.ana logical connections file)

If you have good ideas or questions about this application, please feel 
free to send email to me.
